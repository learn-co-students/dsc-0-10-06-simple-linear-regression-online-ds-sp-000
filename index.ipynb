    "## Introduction\n",
    "Regression analysis is usually the first real \"learning\" algorithm that aspiring data scientists will come across. It is one of the simplest algorithms to master but still requires some statistical understanding of the underlying regression process. This lesson will introduce you to regression process based on the statistical ideas we have discovered so far. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Describe statistical modeling with simple regression \n",
    "* Explain simple linear regression as solving for equation y=mx+c\n",
    "* Calculate the slope and y-intercept using the slope value\n",
    "* Draw a regression line based on calculated slope and intercept\n",
    "* Predict the target of a previously unseen input feature"

    "So far, we have covered topics like basic hypothesis testing, variable relationships, statistical learning. We shall now build on these ideas to explain the regression process. Regression is a parametric technique used to **predict** the value of a target variable Y based on one or more input feature variables X. Regression is proven to give credible results if the data follows parametric assumptions which will be covered in upcoming lessons. Regression Analysis helps us with analytics in following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Finding an association, relationship between variables.\n",
    "* Identifying which variables contribute more towards the outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "and most importantly ..\n",

    "* **Prediction** of future observations. \n",

    "## Why is it called \"linear\" regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in pevious lesson, linear implies that the model functions along a straight or nearly straight line. Linear suggests that the relationship between dependent and independent variable can be expressed in a straight line. A **Simple Linear Regression**  uses a single feature (independent variable) to predict a target (dependent variable) by fitting a best linear relationship, whereas **Multiple Linear Regression** uses more than one features to predict a target variable by fitting a best linear relationship. In this section, we shall mainly focus on simple regression to build a sound understanding. \n",

    "* y is the dependent variable i.e. the variable that needs to be estimated and predicted.\n",
    "* x is the independent variable i.e. the variable that is controllable. It is the input.\n",

    "\n",
    "The y-intercept (b) is the value on the y-axis **where the line crosses the axis**. For example, in the equation y= 2x +2, the line crosses the y-axis at the value b = 2. The coordinates of this point would be (0, 2). \n",
    ">When a line crosses the y-axis, the x-value is always 0.\n",

    "You may be thinking that you have to try lots and lots of different lines to see which one fits best. Fortunately, this task is not as complicated as in may seem . Given some data points, the best-fit line always has a distinct slope and y-intercept that can be calculated using simple linear algebraic approaches."
